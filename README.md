# Notion-no-sidebar

This is a tampermonkey / greasemonkey userscript for changing the default behaviour of notion's sidebar. 

I only recently started learning coding, so this is messy AF and someone can probably easily make this much more effective.

The function adds a button into the DOM that then manipulates the sidebar behaviour position and visibility. 
When the sidebar is set to hidden, it no longer appears on hover. Clicking the button makes it appear again.
